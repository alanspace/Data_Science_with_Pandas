## Sales Analysis
This is a project using pandas to analyse the sales productivity. By means of data analysis, we can answer the following questions:

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most?
6. Why do you think it sold the most?

By answering these questions, we can make a better decision on sales invesment, it can definitely help the firm to gain profit by visualizing the data.
